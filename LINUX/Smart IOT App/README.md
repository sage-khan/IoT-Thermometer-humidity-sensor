# Home Automation

## Overview

Automation such as home automation has become important in
today’s world as it helps to complete a task with lesser human
assistance and in a smarter way.
Nowadays there are many problems which needs to be solved. we have tried some of them in our project.
__Our main priority is to provide ease to the end user by automating the
process over wifi.__

## Why Home Automation

Home automation is a network of hardware, communication, and electronic interfaces that work to integrate everyday devices with one another via the Internet.
Each device has sensors and is connected through WiFi, so you can manage them from your smartphone or tablet whether you're at home, or miles away.

## Problems we have solved in Our Project
1. Realtime water tank level indicator. 
2. Process of making  tea or coffee. 
3. Realtime temperatures of the Room.

#### Realtime water tank level indicator 
* User will be able check water level in real time on mobile application. if the water level is above the critical level it will generate a 
 notification, and if the water level is below the required level it will also generate notification.
* User Will also know how many litres of water has gone on tank or how many litres of water each floor has through mobile app. 
#### Advantages: 
* The purpose of a water level indicator is to gauge and manage water levels in a
water tank
* Automatic water level indicators ensure no overflows or running of dry pumps.
* Saves money by using less water and electricity
* Can help avoid seepage of walls and roofs due to tanks overflowing
* Consumes very little energy, perfect for continuous operation.

#### Process of making Tea or Coffee 
You can use the app to control your WiFi-enabled coffee machine from the Home Connect range of Bosch and other home appliance brands using your smartphone or tablet.
##### Controlling a Home Connect Coffee Machine with App
+ In addition, the Home Connect coffee world feature in the app continually provides you with new coffee ideas and takes note of your favourite creations. 
Just as you like it!
+ Your WiFi-enabled coffee machine uses the app to send you a reminder telling you that your milk or coffee beans are running out.
+The app is intuitive to use and your dashboard is designed to be simple.
+Use the demo appliances right now to see how you can control appliances with the Home Connect app – even if you haven't yet connected an appliance up to Home Connect.

##### Control your coffee machine with your voice
Enjoy the advantages of smart voice control: Read about how you can control your coffee machine with your voice here – from the comfort of your own sofa!


#### Realtime temperatures of the Room 
User will be able to check the temperature of the last 24 hours through mobile appplication.
###### Advantages
It will help the user to be prepared for different temperature situations. 
* If it is hot the user will open Air Condition 
* When the temperature is cold user will do what is necessary e.g __Open a Heater__
