[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/percona/community/blob/main/content/contribute/coc.md)

Percona Community is a community around developing, installing, running, optimizing, learning everything around databases and the needed infrastructure.

## The ABCs

* **A**ssume good intentions.
* **B**e nice to each other - being civil and respectful goes a long way.
* **C**riticize code, tools, other types of contributions, and situations - not people and their personalities.

## Rules

We respect all members of the Percona Community - that involves everyone’s contributions in code, text, visuals, and chat. Your contributions might take place in one of our GitHub organizations, on [Jira](https://jira.percona.com/projects/PMM/issues) or on the [forum](https://forums.percona.com/c/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm-v2).

We all are committed to participating in a community where abuse and harrassment is neither tolerated nor accepted. If you want to give feedback, remember to criticize the code or other type of contribution, not the person.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by Percona’s community members include:
* Spam
* Personal attacks
* Any form of harassment (public, private, online, offline)
* Sexual and sexualized language/imagery, including links to these
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct
* Any malicious activity intended to cause any technical or other disruption

## Consequences

Project maintainers have the right to remove or edit an individual’s contributions from this project should they find that they are not adhering to this Code of Conduct. Repeat or severe offenders may also be permanently banned from having a space in the community. This Code of Conduct is applicable to all members of the Percona Community, including project maintainers and Percona employees and applies to all spaces (online and in-person) where someone is representing this community.

## Contact

If you notice any unacceptable behavior, let us know as soon as possible by writing to [community-team@percona.com](mailto:community-team@percona.com). We will respond within 48 hours.
